                <h2>The Challenge</h2>
                <p>Retrodirective Wireless Power Transfer (RWPT) systems require precise phase conjugation to ensure high-efficiency beam focusing. 
                    The core challenge in this design is that the input (RF) and output (IF) signals both operate in the 2.4–2.5 GHz ISM band. 
                    This close frequency proximity causes significant RF signal leakage, which introduces jitter and compromises the required phase conjugation accuracy for beamforming. 
                    To address this issue, we developed and incorporated a SIC technique into the phase conjugator circuit.</p>

                    The system uses a retro-directive RF array to achieve retrodirectivity by converting received signals (<em>+&theta;<sub>n</sub></em>) into transmitted signals with conjugated phases (<em>-&theta;<sub>n</sub></em> ), 
                    thus automatically focusing power back to the source.

                    The proposed phase conjugator IC is the core of this function. 
                    Operating at 2.4–2.5 GHz, the chip consists of a Mixer for phase conjugation, a VCO, and an isolation enhancement block.
                    A double-balanced mixer was selected for phase conjugation due to its superior isolation characteristics between ports. 
                    The pMOS VCO was chosen for its low phase noise characteristics
                    <br><br>
                    To reduce the jitter in the conjugated signals and improve beamforming accuracy, a leakage power cancellation technique was incorporated. 
                    The canceller consists of four blocks: a power divider, an attenuator, a phase shifter, and a power combiner. A small portion of the signal is extracted from
the                 input port, and its magnitude and phase are adjusted by the attenuator and phase shifter to cancel leakage power at the output using the power combiner.
The                 input power divider and output power combiner are realized using a directional coupler and a Wilkinson combiner, respectively.

                    Traditional wireless circulators and isolators rely on bulky ferrite materials and external magnetic fields, making them incompatible with compact CMOS IC fabrication. 
                    Existing active circulators suffer from high noise and poor linearity, creating a critical need for an integrated, high-performance solution.
                    To achieve magnet-less non-reciprocity, this study employs Linear Periodically Time-Varying (LPTV) circuits. 
                    We developed a fully integrated circulator IC that uses multi-path staggered commutation networks.
                    We also proposed a novel use of non-Foster elements to widen isolation bandwidth.
