                <h2>The Challenge</h2>
                <p>Retro-directive array (RDA) has been considered a good candidate for beamforming and has well-established efficiency in wireless communication systems for years. 
                    One of the most important components in the RF system for the RDA is a circulator. However, the isolation characteristic of circulator between
                    transmitter (TX) output and receiver (RX) input affects the performance of the array system not only in terms of sensitivity but also beamforming accuracy.
                    There have been many recent reports performing leakage signal cancelation, typically in the antenna interface and RF both in frequency and time domains.
                    However, in terms of bandwidth and isolation, those are still not efficient and compatible for the retro-directive short-range WPT system.

                    We propose the use of phase conjugate technique which is preferable to realize the power transmission retrodirective radar system. 
                    The operating frequency is chosen at 2.4 GHz, which is defined for industrial, scientific and medical (ISM) using. 
                    The phase conjugating circuit will be implemented by commercial devices as well as CMOS technology. 
                    The phase conjugating circuitry contains five blocks such as voltage controlled oscillator (VCO), low noise amplifier (LNA), mixer,power amplifier (PA).
                    <br><br>
                    Mixer plays a major role in translating input RF signal down to the IF signal of interest. 
                    This mixer circuit employs a well-known double balance Gilbert-cell on which has a differential input 
                    sensing signal from LNA, LO signal generated by VCO and the differential IF at output.
                    The signal after being translated by mixeris not sufficiently large to convey over the long distance.
                    Thus, magnifying the IF signal to a level is a major job that the PA at transmitting path should involve in
                    <br><br>
                    Due to the imperfect isolation of circulator, a large TX leakage signal at 2.4 GHz is fed into RX amplifiers.
                    Using SAW filters to reduce the leakage signals is expensive, bulky, and incompatible with CMOS integration. 
                    Hence, a proposal of Circulator Leakage Canceller (CLC) is our target to serve for leakage suppression in current RDA
                    system as well as could be applied to other systems having a similar frequency plan.
                    The proposed CLC consists of a directional coupler (DC), a hybrid coupler, and a low-pass filter network (LPFN) integrated with Negative Capacitor (NCAP).

                    Simulation of Mixer shows the P1dB of -23 dBm while AM-PM is roughly 0.1 degree/dB. 
                    This P1dB point shows that for each an increase of 20 dB input power from one end of mixer, 
                    the phase locating in IF signal is modulated by approximate 2 degress from the other end.
                    LNA with the drive amplifier (DA) circuit has the gain of 43 dB which can push the small signal sensed by antenna up to some extents 
                    such that it goes beyond the P1dB point of -23 dBm and falls into the saturation region in mixer. 
                    <br><br><br>
                    The feedforward path is first designed with an attenuator and phase shifter, such that the RF CLC can perform high cancelation 
                    at every single frequency in the bandwidth of interest. 
                    The set of achieved phase shifts and attenuations at individual points provides the combined responses as the solid lines. 
                    The simulation shows that with NCAP = −2 pF, both phase and magnitude LPFN offer the best matching with requirements.
                    <br><br><br><br>
                    To prevent LPFN from process voltage temperature (PVT) variations, NCAP was designed with CL metal insulator metal (MIM) capacitor banks 
                    to provide phase tunability of approximately 50 degrees.
                    Because of the frequencyplanning of the retro-directive RF system, the LPFN was designed to obtain the first- and second-best isolation at
                    2.5 and 2.4 GHz, respectively, to improve minimum sensitivity, mitigate linearity requirements, and reduce filtering burden in the RX.
